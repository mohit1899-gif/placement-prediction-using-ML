## README

### Introduction
Welcome to the **Campus Placement Predictor** project, designed to forecast a student's likelihood of placement using machine learning techniques. This tool comes equipped with a user-friendly Tkinter GUI for seamless interaction.

### Dataset Description
The dataset employed for this project encompasses various student attributes, including academic scores, specialization, work experience, etc., with the target variable being the placement outcome.

### Setup Instructions

1. First, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/campus-placement-predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd campus-placement-predictor
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### How to Use

#### Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Campus_Placement_Predictor.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the cells to:
   - Load and examine the dataset
   - Process the data
   - Train the predictive model
   - Assess the model's performance

#### Running the Tkinter GUI
1. To launch the GUI:
   ```bash
   python placement_gui.py
   ```
2. Input student details and press the "Predict" button to receive the placement prediction.

### Model Details

#### Data Preparation
- **Initial Exploration:** Preview the dataset and obtain basic statistical information.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Address any missing values within the dataset.
- **Feature Transformation:** Convert categorical data into numerical format as required.

#### Model Training Process
- **Model Selection:** Select and train the machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.).
- **Optimization:** Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter tuning methods like GridSearchCV.
- **Training and Validation:** Train the model using the training set and evaluate its accuracy on the test set.

#### Performance Evaluation
- **Metrics:** Assess model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the classification results.

### Project Outcomes
The model achieved an accuracy of `X%` (insert actual accuracy) on the test data, demonstrating its predictive power.
